## 🛠️ Key Technology Used

* **HTML:** Provides the `<canvas>` element (the drawing surface).
* **CSS:** Sets the dark background, centers the text, and applies the text glow effect.
* **JavaScript (Canvas 2D API):** Contains the core logic for:
    * Drawing the organic **curved stems** using `quadraticCurveTo()`.
    * Creating the soft, elegant **petal shapes**.
    * Adding the beautiful **glow effect** using `ctx.shadowBlur`.
    * Handling the user's mouse **click events**.
